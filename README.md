**Senior Software Engineer | Cloud Architect | Founder, Composite Logic**

I am a Senior Software Engineer at **Cox Automotive**, where I drive the technical direction for backend APIs within the DMS+ platform. My career is defined by a hybrid strength: deep technical expertise in distributed systems combined with **years of operational management experience**.

This dual background allows me to operate effectively at the intersection of code and commerce. I don't just design systems that work technically; I architect solutions that align with business strategy, team capacity, and long-term organizational goals.

### Professional Focus

My approach to engineering is heavily influenced by my management background. I prioritize **predictability** and **leverage** over complexity.

* **Technical Strategy:** Designing event-driven architectures (AWS EventBridge, Lambda, SQS) that solve actual business problems rather than chasing trends.
* **Engineering Leadership:** utilizing my management experience to mentor teams, drive consensus on architectural decisions, and translate technical constraints for executive stakeholders.
* **Operational Rigor:** Championing Infrastructure as Code (CDK) and observability not just for stability, but to provide clear metrics on system health and ROI.

### Projects & Ventures

**Composite Logic**
I founded Composite Logic to provide high-tech architectural consulting. It serves as a vehicle to apply enterprise-grade management principles to cloud-native system design.

**Reference Architecture: Event-Driven Systems**
I maintain a reference repository demonstrating production-grade patterns, focusing on the "Day 2" operations that managers care about: maintainability, cost-control, and security governance.

### Personal

Based in **Sandy, Utah**, I balance my technical work with landscape photography. I have found that the patience required to capture the perfect light mirrors the discipline needed to lead teams and build enduring software.

When not working, I am dissecting the works of Stephen King or preparing for the arrival of my second daughter.
